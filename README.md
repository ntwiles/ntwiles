## Hi, I'm Nathan.
I love making great software. I do full-stack web development and make games. I work mostly in C#. Here are some of my favorite projects.

### Nala Language
Nala is an interpreted programming language I've created. Nala consists of a lexer, parser, and interpreter written in C#, and comes bundled with a WIP desktop application for use as an IDE/code editor. As of now, Nala has support for console i/o, most arithmetic operations, variable scoping, and conditional branching, and has enough functionality to implement basic console applications.

### Sorting Algorithms
I wrote this project as a way to better my understanding of many common sorting algorithms, and also to get some practice with C#'s features for concurrent programming.
