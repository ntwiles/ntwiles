## Hi, I'm Nathan.
I love making great software. I do full-stack web development and make games. I work mostly in C#. Here are some of my favorite projects.

### Nala Language
Nala is an interpreted programming language I've created. Right now, Nala supports console i/o, most mathematical operations, variable scoping, and conditional branching, and is in a usable state for writing many simple console applications. 

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

### Sorting Algorithms
I wrote this project as a way to better my understanding of many common sorting algorithms, and also to get some practice with C#'s features for concurrent programming.
