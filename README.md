## Hi, I'm Nathan.
I do full-stack web development and make games. I work mostly in C#. Here are some of my favorite projects.

### Nala Language
Nala is an interpreted [programming language](https://github.com/ntwiles/nala) I'm working on. It's in a pretty stable state and has enough functionality to write a lot of basic console applications.

### Sorting Algorithms
I wrote this project as a way to better my understanding of many common [sorting algorithms]https://github.com/ntwiles/sorting-algorithms, and also to get some practice with C#'s features for concurrent programming.

### Acid 
This is a Myst-inspired game I created as part of a game jam. The code is [hosted here](https://github.com/ntwiles/acid) on GitHub and the game is [playable here](https://ntwiles.itch.io/acid).
