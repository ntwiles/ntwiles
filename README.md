## Hi, I'm Nathan.
I love making great software. I do full-stack web development and make games. I work mostly in C#. Here are some of my favorite projects.

### Nala Language
Nala is an interpreted programming language I'm working on. It's in a pretty stable state and has enough functionality to write a lot of basic console applications. Check it out!

### Sorting Algorithms
I wrote this project as a way to better my understanding of many common sorting algorithms, and also to get some practice with C#'s features for concurrent programming.
