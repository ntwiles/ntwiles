##Hi, I'm Nathan.
I love making great software. I do full-stack web development and make games. C# is my happy place, but I'm always excited to learn new languages.

Want to get in touch? Feel free to contact me below.

I'm probably coding one of my projects, but I've got a few other things that keep me excited.

- Reading (sci fi)
- Cooking (pad thai)
- Learning German (wie geht's?)
