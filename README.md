**👋 Hi, I'm Nathan.**

I do full-stack web development and make games. I love TypeScript and Rust.

**🔨 What I'm Working On**

I enjoy building my own versions of the tools programmers use every day in order to get a better understanding of how they work. Right now I'm building [Nala](https://github.com/ntwiles/nala), my own interpreted programming language, and also working on Nit, a simple Git clone. Both projects are written in Rust.
