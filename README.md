I do full-stack web development. I love TypeScript and Rust, and Python.

**What I'm Working On**

I enjoy building my own versions of the tools programmers use every day to get a better understanding of how they work. 

Right now I'm building [Nala](https://github.com/ntwiles/nala), my own interpreted programming language, as well as a [custom game engine](https://github.com/ntwiles/game-engine), and also working on [Nit](https://github.com/ntwiles/nit), a simple Git clone. Each of these projects are written in Rust.
